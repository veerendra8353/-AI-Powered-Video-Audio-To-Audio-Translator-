# Speech-to-Speech Translation

Real-time speech-to-speech language translation using:
- ASR (Speech Recognition)
- Machine Translation
- TTS (Text to Speech)

## Run in Colab
Upload `notebooks/speech_to_speech_colab_.ipynb` to Google Colab and run all cells.

## Structure

This project is an end-to-end AI-based translation system that converts spoken content from one language to another language in audio form. It supports audio and video inputs and produces translated speech output, enabling seamless multilingual communication.

The system integrates Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Machine Translation (MT), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) into a single automated pipeline and is implemented using Python and Jupyter/Google Colab
